# Click-Through-Rate-Prediction
By predicting the click-through rate, an advertising company select the most potential visitors who are most likely to respond to the ads, analyzing their browsing history and showing the most relevant ads based on the interest of the user.
This task is important for every advertising agency because the commercial value of promotions on the Internet depends only on how the user responds to them. A userâ€™s response to ads is very valuable to every ad company because it allows the company to select the ads that are most relevant to users.
This project will be important for the ones who want to work as a data scientist at big names like Google and Facebook, who's main revenue model is Ads.

I used Jupyter Notebook, so that's the reason the extension is .ipynb and not py, this code is basically based on Python.
